# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 30/04/2024

Thank you for using Kibisis! This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle user information and ensures transparency about the data practices associated with our browser extension.

## No Collection of Personal Information

We want to make it clear that Kibisis does not collect any personal information from its users. We do not gather, store, or transmit any data that could be used to identify you personally. Your privacy is of utmost importance to us.

## AVM Wallet Functionality

Our browser extension is designed to provide a seamless and secure experience for managing your AVM wallet. It operates locally on your device and does not send any information to external servers. All sensitive data related to your wallet, such as private keys, remains securely stored on your device and is not shared with us or any third parties.

## Usage Analytics with Opt-in Option

By default, Kibisis does not use tracking mechanisms, and we ensure that your interactions with Kibisis are private and free from any form of surveillance.

However, Kibisis does offer the option for you to opt-in to action-based analytics. By opting in, you can earn rewards for certain actions performed while using Kibisis, but rest assured, participation is entirely voluntary and all data collected is compliant with GDPR and CCPA regulations.

## Security Measures

While we do not collect personal information, we take security seriously. We employ industry-standard encryption and security measures to protect your wallet data and ensure the integrity of our extension. Our goal is to provide you with a trustworthy and secure environment for managing your AVM assets.

## Updates to the Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.
