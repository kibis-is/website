## Overview

<!-- change just the version for new posts -->
We are proud to present a new milestone in the development of Kibisis: v1.16.0!

<!-- re-write this paragraph for all new versions -->
On the journey to fully embrace ARC-0200 assets, the latest version of Kibisis now displays a richer appearance for outgoing ARC-0200 transactions. Not only that, we have also added a few nuggets such as already added assets appearing in the add asset list.

## Features

### Richer Outgoing ARC-0200 Transactions

Abstractly speaking, ARC-0200 are assets, however, their underlying implementation is using a smart contract (application). Therefore, they would appear like any other application in the activity list.

With the latest update, outgoing ARC-0200 assets appear as asset transfers, with the amount debited from the holdings.

  }}
/>

### Already Added Assets

For assets that have already been added, they will now appear in the asset list when searching for assets to add.

/>

### Key Registration Transaction Via QR Code

Key registration transactions can be parsed and posted by the Kibisis' QR scanner. This enables Kibisis to be used as potential method to register a key without having to store a key on a node.

Furthermore, the QR scanner can now be used to scan other windows on the screen, not just the browser.

:::note

This is still a work in-progress. Stay tuned for more updates on this work as the team is also working on recognizing the URI in the browser address.

## Fixes

* Seed phrase input gaps decreased to fit a full mnemonic (English BIP-39 compatible) word.
* ARC-0200 assets with a large total supply should now appear in the "Add Asset" search.
