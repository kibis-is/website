## Overview

<!-- change just the version for new posts -->
We are proud to present a new milestone in the development of Kibisis: v1.12.0!

<!-- re-write this paragraph for all new versions -->
The latest features of v1.12.0 mostly center around the extended use of the QR code. Kibisis can now utilize your device's camera and scan a QR code! But that is not all, you can also add ARC-0200 assets via a QR code.

Below you will find more details about what is new in this release.

<!-- go into detail about the new versions, or omit if no new features with in the release -->
## Features

### Scan A QR Code Via Your Device's Camera

Currently, to scan a QR code, a code would need to be displayed on the active tab of your browser. However, Kibisis can now utilize your device's camera and scan a QR code from any that maybe displayed by the camera.

As shown below, you will be presented with the option to scan using your camera, or the browser window.

  label="Scan QR code selection"
  maxWidth="400px"
  imageSources={{
    dark: scanViaCameraDarkImage,
    light: scanViaCameraLightImage,
  }}
/>

> ⚠️ **NOTE:** You will need to allow access for Kibisis to use your camera. You can change this permission at anytime by removing it from your browser settings.

### Scan QR Code To Add Assets

Adding assets can sometimes be cumbersome, however, assets can now be added using a QR code! Once you scan a compatible code you will be presented with a modal to confirm you want to add the asset.

  maxWidth="400px"
  imageSources={{
    dark: addAssetViaQRCodeDarkImage,
    light: addAssetViaQRCodeLightImage,
  }}
/>

Here is an example of adding VIA to Voi testnet:

```
avm://asset/add/6779767?genesishash=IXnoWtviVVJW5LGivNFc0Dq14V3kqaXuK2u5OQrdVZo=&type=arc0200
```

What's more, you can visit [https://avm-asset-list.agoralabs.sh](https://avm-asset-list.agoralabs.sh) to easily search and add from a curated list of popular ARC-0200 assets, across all networks (even testnet!).

### ARC-0200 Assets Automatically Added Via QR Code Account Import

When importing an account via a QR code, a new query param can be added to the URI that allows you to automatically add ARC-0200 assets.

Here is an example of importing an account with multiple ARC-0200 assets

```
avm://account/import?privatekey=...&encoding=hex&asset=6779767,6795477
```

> ⚠️ **NOTE:** The new asset param is a comma separated list of ARC-0200 IDs.

### Account Selection Persists Through Restarts

A small, but nice, feature is that whenever you switch account, this choice persists whenever Kibisis is closed and re-opened. This persistence also extends to the account's tabs.

### First Account Is Selected On Enable Session

When connecting an account, the first choice in the account list is automatically selected.

<!-- just give a bulleted list of fixes, or omit if no fixes with in the release -->
