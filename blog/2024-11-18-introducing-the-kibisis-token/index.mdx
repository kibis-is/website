We are creating a fungible token that can be used as currency for our upcoming marketplace.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why?

The token will be the main form of currency to purchase from an upcoming marketplace that we are currently building. This marketplace will allow customization of your wallets by buying skins and themes. These skins and themes will be sent to your account as NFTs - allowing you to transfer or sell just like any other NFT.

With one of these NFTs in your account, you can customize your Kibisis wallet. Furthermore, these customizations will also appear in another user's Kibisis wallet that you have interacted with.

For example, if you have added a solid gold skin to your Kibisis wallet, and you send some VOI to another Kibisis user, the transaction in their activity will also appear in this solid gold theme.

We hope to share more details of the Kibisis marketplace soon as it is still in early development.

## Bootstrapping Period

To bootstrap the token we will be holding what we are calling a "bootstrapping period".

During this period, we will load up a special contract with 500,000,000 (500 million) tokens (0.5% of the total supply), and you will be able to acquire these tokens by exchanging VOI directly with the contract - no exchanges, bridges or swaps, just direct with the contract.

The cost of the Kibisis token during this period will be 1:1 to VOI.

## Token Technical Details

* **Total Supply:** 10,000,000,000 (10 billion)
* **Decimals:** 6
* **Symbol:** `$KIBI` (TBC...)

## Feedback Welcome

We are still ironing out the finer details, but we are very much open to any feedback you may have.
