## Overview

<!-- change just the version for new posts -->
We are proud to present a new milestone in the development of Kibisis: v1.8.0!

<!-- re-write this paragraph for all new versions -->
First and foremost, a Merry Christmas ðŸŽ„ from the team here at <a href={AGORA_LABS_LINK} target="_blank">Agora Labs</a>! The new version of Kibisis, version 1.8.0, is all about supporting ARC-200 tokens, the sexy new type of AVM assets. But that's not all, we have also brought in Standard Asset opt-ins as well as various fixes that squash some annoying bugs.

Below you will find more details about what is new in this release.

## Features

### ARC-200 Support

The new ARC-200 token standard represents a major upgrade for assets on the AVM (Algorand Virtual Machine). They allow assets to utilize the power of smart contracts, by actually _being_ a smart contract!

ARC-200 tokens have been inspired by the equivalent [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) on EVM chains. ERC-20 tokens underpin almost all tokens on EVM and so it is only fitting that AVM also has an asset of similar standard.

The team here at Agora Labs have been working hard over Christmas to get ARC-200 support ready. With version 1.8.0, you can not add an ARC-200 asset, if you know the application ID:

    light: addArc200AssetLightImage,
  }}
/>

The beauty of ARC-200 is that it is _free_ to opt-in, yes that is right, ARC-200 does not require a fee to opt-in!

Once the ARC-200 asset has been added, it will appear in your asset holdings, and you will be able to check your balance, send and receive!

/>

To learn more about ARC-200, make sure you check out the specification [here](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0200).

### Standard Asset Opt-in

Although there is a lot of talk about ARC-200, let us not forget one of the most powerful features of the AVM: Standard Assets. These assets are baked into the very heart of the AVM protocol and are a feature that makes AVM chains the best in class.

The new version of Kibisis allows you to opt-in to standard assets, using an opt-in transaction, which, at the time of writing will cost you 0.01; the standard fee amount.
