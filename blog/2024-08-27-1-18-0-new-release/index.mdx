## Overview

<!-- change just the version for new posts -->
We are proud to present a new milestone in the development of Kibisis: v1.18.0!

<!-- re-write this paragraph for all new versions -->
This version of Kibisis comes with a lot of updates. First and foremost, we have re-skinned a lot of UI elements and with this come a fair few fixes for a lot of old bugs (reported and unreported ones). Furthermore, we have also added the ability to add your own custom nodes so you no longer have to rely on public nodes for your interactions with the network.

As an added bonus (and for us a very exciting feature), we have added support for passkeys for authentication!

## Features

### New UI

Kibisis has had some UI love ❤️.

In a bid to make a lot of the elements more cohesive and to improve elements that are buggy under certain conditions. Wallet-wide, there have been UI enhancements and we hope you enjoy these, and, as always, please feel free to send us some feedback.

### Custom Nodes

Kibisis' default node service it uses to communicate with the network is the free node that is provided by the very awesome and fantastic folks over at [Nodely](https://nodely.io/). However, you may want to you use your own node.

By going to Settings > Advanced > "Custom Nodes", you can add nodes for each network. You can decide which one to activate or deactivate and all interactions with the network will go through your activated node.

### Note Fields Have A 1kb Limit

Transaction notes are limited to 1024 bytes or 1024 characters. Note fields now have a limit and a transaction will not be able to be sent if this limit is exceeded.

With the aforementioned UI enhancements, there is a handy "characters remaining" indicator as you type to let you know how many characters are remaining.

### Passkey Authentication

A pain point for most users are passwords. While strong passwords are a necessary evil to ensure strong private key encryption, they are not the only form of authentication.

[Passkeys](https://www.passkeys.com/) allow for password-less authentication and Kibisis now supports using passkeys in lieu of a password. Your account's private keys are encrypted/decrypted using a passkey making for a far more seamless experience, without compromising on security.

Try it now by going to Settings > Security > Passkey.

:::note

As the passkeys are being used for encryption, they require a certain type of extension (PRF - see BitWarden's excellent blog [post](https://bitwarden.com/blog/prf-webauthn-and-its-role-in-passkeys/) for a brief explanation). Currently, only certain passkeys support this type extension, so not all passkeys will work.

:::caution

This is currently an experimental feature and is still a work in progress.
