We would like to share a big part of our wider vision for Kibisis: skins and themes for your wallet can be purchased, using the Kibisis token, via our upcoming marketplace.

## Why?

As a wallet, Kibisis sits at the nexus of a lot of web3 services, it is therefore important that it functions well. However, while an app's functionality is indeed important, aesthetics also plays a part in why we choose/use applications. Therefore, we would like to announce that we are developing a marketplace that will allow you to customize the aesthetics of Kibisis!

This upcoming marketplace will use the aforementioned token as the main form of currency to purchase items. These customizations, in the form of skins and themes, will be sent to your account as NFTs - allowing you to transfer, or sell, just like any other NFT.

With one of these NFTs in your account, you can customize your Kibisis wallet. Furthermore, these customizations will also appear in another user's Kibisis wallet that you have interacted with.

For example, if you have added a solid gold skin to your Kibisis wallet, and you send some VOI to another Kibisis user, the transaction in their activity will also appear in this solid gold theme.

We hope to share more details of the Kibisis marketplace soon as it is still in early development.

## Bootstrapping Period

To kick off the token launch we will be holding what we are calling a "bootstrapping period".

During this period, we will load up a special contract with a percentage of the total supply of tokens, and you will be able to acquire these tokens by exchanging VOI directly with the contract - no exchanges, bridges or swaps, just direct with the contract.

We will announce the official details and dates of this bootstrapping period soon.

## Token Technical Details

* **Total Supply:** 10,000,000,000 (10 billion)
* **Decimals:** 6
* **Symbol:** `$KIBI` (TBC...)

## Feedback Welcome

We are still ironing out the finer details, but we are very much open to any feedback you may have.

You can drop us a message in the Voi Discord on the [#kibisis](https://discord.com/channels/1055863853633785857/1181252381816655952) channel.
