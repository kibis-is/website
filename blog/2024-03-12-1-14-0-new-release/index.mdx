We are proud to present a new milestone in the development of Kibisis: v1.14.0!

It has been a long time coming, but we are very excited to announce the release of NFTs! You can now view your ARC-0072 NFTs under the NFT tab on the accounts page.

## Features

### ARC-0072 NFT Support

You can not see all your ARC-0072 NFTs under the NFT tab. Your NFTs should automatically appear under this tab (no need to manually).

/>

And you can see more information about the NFT by selecting one.

    light: nftViewLightImage,
  }}
/>

### Remove Standard Asset

If like us, you participated in the early access Voi Winter Games, you may have been given a standard asset and wanted to remove it. Well, version 1.14.0 now allows you to opt-out of a standard asset.

  maxWidth="400px"
  imageSources={{
    dark: removeASADarkImage,
    light: removeASALightImage,
  }}
/>

> ⚠️ **NOTE:** There is a transaction fee associated with "opting-out" of standard assets. This is a protocol requirement and cannot be avoided, unlike ARC-0200 assets.

### Minimum Balance Requirement Error Message

A new error message is shown, if your account falls below the minimum balance requirement for a transaction. Either sending assets, adding assets or removing assets.
