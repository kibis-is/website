## Voi mainnet is upon us!

Hello fellow Voiagers!

As you may be aware, Voi will soon be releasing mainnet and as a user of Kibisis you have been part of this extraordinary journey. Therefore, we at Kibisis would like to cordially invite you to undertake a few quests to earn rewards that will be redeemable once we enter mainnet.

## Repeatable quests

Repeatable quests are simple, every day actions that have varying reward multipliers depending on the ease of the task. These quests can be repeated as many times as you like and include, but not limited to:

* Sending some VOI to another account
* Sending some VIA (or any ARC-0200 asset) to another account
* Sending some standard assets to another account
* Acquiring an NFT
* ... and more!

## "Feat Of Strength" quests

"Feat Of Strength" quests are hidden quests that include not very well known/used features. These quests have high multipliers and can only be performed once but may earn extra special rewards!

## How do I start completing quests?

With the launch of v1.15.0, you will receive a message that will allow you to opt in to quests. Either press "Yes, I'm in!" or "Cancel" if you wish to start completing quests.

If you missed the message or pressed cancel, and you have decided that you want to opt-in, you can go to **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Allow certain actions to be tracked?**.

    dark: allowActionTrackingDarkImage,
    light: allowActionTrackingLightImage,
  }}
/>

You can opt out at any time by repeating the above procedure and toggling off **Allow certain actions to be tracked?**.

:::note

We will need to gather and transmit the quests to a remote server and each quest completion will be referenced by the address and/or asset ID that completed it. This is a small deviation from Kibisis' [privacy policy](/privacy-policy) and, as such, we have updated the [privacy policy](/privacy-policy#usage-analytics-with-opt-in-option) to accommodate this new clause. However, this is completely voluntary, and if you choose not to opt-in, no data will be gathered and transmitted.

## Closing Words

Thank you for your continued interest in Kibisis! We hope you are enjoying using it.

It has been an epic ride so far, and we could not have got this far without your continued support.
