## Overview

<!-- change just the version for new posts -->
We are proud to present a new milestone in the development of Kibisis: v1.17.0!

<!-- re-write this paragraph for all new versions -->
The latest release from Kibisis brings one of the stand-out and staple features of the AVM: re-keyed accounts. This release also packs an extra feature-punch with watch accounts and quest completion notifications.

Below you will find more details about what else is new in this release.

<!-- go into detail about the new versions, or omit if no new features with in the release -->
## Features

### Re-keyed Account Support

Re-keyed accounts are a core foundation of AVM and one of our favourite features here at Kibisis, therefore, we are proud of the work that has gone into getting this feature implemented.

When you have a re-keyed account, you will see the re-keyed badges being displayed on the account screen and in the sidebar.

    light: reKeyAccountViewLightImage,
  }}
/>

:::note

In order to use the re-keyed account, you will need the authorized account present in the wallet.

:::

For accounts that don't have the authorized account present in the wallet, they will also contain a [watch](#watch-accounts) account badge.

  }}
/>

For a more detailed overview of what re-keying is, checkout Algorand's excellent [article](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/accounts/rekey/) on its ins and outs.

### Watch Accounts

A happy side effect of re-keying was the need for a watch account. Watch accounts are accounts that can be added without the need of a seed phrase (private key), all that is required is the public address of the account.

Watch accounts will appear alongside normal accounts, but will be designated by a watch account badge and will have limited functionality (essentially anything that requires signing, i.e. sending assets, adding standard assets).

### Quest Completion Notification

Quests have been tracked since their implementation since the last [release](/blog/version-1-16-0-release), however, there was no indication that quests were completed.

The latest release displays a notification (and some confetti) when a quest has been completed. For an overview of your completed quests (on Voi), check out the [Voi Rewards Calculator](https://voirewards.com/phase2).

### Kibisis-specific Key Registration URI

Kibisis already parses a QR encoded key registration transaction URI, but you can now parse a URI from the browser's address bar. Simply prefix the URI with the word "kibisis" and Kibisis will attempt to parse the key registration. For example:

```
kibisis avm://transaction/send?genesishash=IXnoWtviVVJW5LGivNFc0Dq14V3kqaXuK2u5OQrdVZo%3D&selectionkey=LrpLhvzr-QpN_bivh6IPpOaKGbGzTTB5lJtVfixmmgk%3D&stateproofkey=RpUpNWfZMjZ1zOOjv3MF2tjO714jsBt0GKnNsw0ihJ4HSZwci-d9zvUi3i67LwFUJgjQ5Dz4zZgHgGduElnmSA%3D%3D&sender=TESTKHUQJXXNSDSTCIY35GL3XMLFWNFEYH3HNATVGBURZR7XJP7C6EYM6Y&type=keyreg&votefirst=1&votekey=G_lqTV6MKspW6J8wH2d8ZliZ5XZVZsruqSBJMwLwlmo%3D&votekeydilution=316&votelast=100000
```

:::warning

The above URI is an example and will fail when posted to the network.

:::note

This feature is part of the larger body of work to integrating generating participation keys for nodes. See [generating participation keys](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/participate/generate_keys/) for more information.

<!-- just give a bulleted list of fixes, or omit if no fixes with in the release -->
## Fixes

* The quest threshold for sending assets has been lowered from greater or equal to 1, to greater than 0.
* Node URLs are used for network pings to avoid false positive network connectivity problems.
