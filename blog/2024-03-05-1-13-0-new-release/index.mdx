## Features

### View Your Seed Phrase

When you create or import account an account, Kibisis uses the seed phrase to get the private key. This private key is encrypted and stored securely in the Kibisis' on-browser storage. Now you can decrypt the private key and convert it back to your original seed phrase, allowing for you to view or copy it.
