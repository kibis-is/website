First and foremost, we have re-skinned a lot of UI elements and with this come a fair few fixes for a lot of old bugs (reported and unreported ones). Furthermore, we have also added the ability to add your own custom nodes so you no longer have to rely on public nodes for your interactions with the network.\\n\\nAs an added bonus (and for us a very exciting feature), we have added support for passkeys for authentication!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nBelow you will find more details about what else is new in this release.\\n\\n\x3c!-- go into detail about the new versions, or omit if no new features with in the release --\x3e\\n## Features\\n\\n### New UI\\n\\nKibisis has had some UI love \u2764\ufe0f.\\n\\nIn a bid to make a lot of the elements more cohesive and to improve elements that are buggy under certain conditions. Wallet-wide, there have been UI enhancements and we hope you enjoy these, and, as always, please feel free to send us some feedback.\\n\\n### Custom Nodes\\n\\nKibisis\' default node service it uses to communicate with the network is the free node that is provided by the very awesome and fantastic folks over at [Nodely](https://nodely.io/). However, you may want to you use your own node.\\n\\nBy going to Settings > Advanced > \\"Custom Nodes\\", you can add nodes for each network. You can decide which one to activate or deactivate and all interactions with the network will go through your activated node.\\n\\n<BlogScreenshotImage\\n  label=\\"List of custom nodes\\"\\n  maxWidth=\\"465px\\"\\n  imageSources={{\\n    dark: customNodeListDarkImage,\\n    light: customNodeListLightImage,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n### Note Fields Have A 1kb Limit\\n\\nTransaction notes are limited to 1024 bytes or 1024 characters. Note fields now have a limit and a transaction will not be able to be sent if this limit is exceeded.\\n\\nWith the aforementioned UI enhancements, there is a handy \\"characters remaining\\" indicator as you type to let you know how many characters are remaining.\\n\\n### Passkey Authentication\\n\\nA pain point for most users are passwords. While strong passwords are a necessary evil to ensure strong private key encryption, they are not the only form of authentication.\\n\\n[Passkeys](https://www.passkeys.com/) allow for password-less authentication and Kibisis now supports using passkeys in lieu of a password. Your account\'s private keys are encrypted/decrypted using a passkey making for a far more seamless experience, without compromising on security.\\n\\nTry it now by going to Settings > Security > Passkey.\\n\\n<BlogScreenshotImage\\n  label=\\"Adding a passkey\\"\\n  maxWidth=\\"465px\\"\\n  imageSources={{\\n    dark: addPasskeyDarkImage,\\n    light: addPasskeyLightImage,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n<BlogScreenshotImage\\n  label=\\"Authenticating with a passkey\\"\\n  maxWidth=\\"465px\\"\\n  imageSources={{\\n    dark: authenticateWithPasskeyDarkImage,\\n    light: authenticateWithPasskeyLightImage,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nAs the passkeys are being used for encryption, they require a certain type of extension (PRF - see BitWarden\'s excellent blog [post](https://bitwarden.com/blog/prf-webauthn-and-its-role-in-passkeys/) for a brief explanation). Currently, only certain passkeys support this type extension, so not all passkeys will work.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::caution\\n\\nThis is currently an experimental feature and is still a work in progress.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### Minor Features\\n\\n* The password timeout now persists when the app is closed.\\n* A 32-character limit has been set on account names.\\n* Export multiple or all or your accounts via QR codes.\\n* When the seed phrase is being displayed, numbers have been added to each word to indicate its positioning in the 25-word seed.\\n\\n\x3c!-- just give a bulleted list of fixes, or omit if no fixes with in the release --\x3e\\n## Fixes\\n\\n\\n* Removed scroll bars.\\n* Added more padding to account items in the sidebar.\\n* NFT indexer requests are no longer sent twice.\\n* Account details update when an NFT metadata is empty.\\n\\n## Closing Words\\n\\n\x3c!-- leave this paragraph as standard sign off --\x3e\\nThank you for your continued interest in Kibisis!

Watch accounts are accounts that can be added without the need of a seed phrase (private key), all that is required is the public address of the account.\\n\\nWatch accounts will appear alongside normal accounts, but will be displayed with a watch account badge and will have limited functionality (essentially anything that requires signing, i.e. sending assets, adding standard assets).\\n\\n<BlogScreenshotImage\\n  label=\\"Account screen displaying the watch account badge\\"\\n  maxWidth=\\"400px\\"\\n  imageSources={{\\n    dark: watchAccountViewDarkImage,\\n    light: watchAccountViewLightImage,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n### Quest Completion Notification\\n\\nQuests have been tracked since their implementation in the last [release](/blog/version-1-16-0-release), however, there was no indication that quests were completed.\\n\\nThe latest release displays a notification (and some confetti for those that love a tada!) when a quest has been completed.\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nFor an overview of your Voi completed quests, check out the awesome [Voi Rewards Calculator](https://voirewards.com/phase2).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### Kibisis-specific Key Registration URI\\n\\nKibisis already parses a QR encoded key registration transaction URI, but you can now parse a URI from the browser\'s address bar. Simply prefix the URI with the word \\"kibisis\\" and Kibisis will attempt to parse the key registration. For example:\\n\\n```\\nkibisis avm://transaction/send?genesishash=IXnoWtviVVJW5LGivNFc0Dq14V3kqaXuK2u5OQrdVZo%3D&selectionkey=LrpLhvzr-QpN_bivh6IPpOaKGbGzTTB5lJtVfixmmgk%3D&stateproofkey=RpUpNWfZMjZ1zOOjv3MF2tjO714jsBt0GKnNsw0ihJ4HSZwci-d9zvUi3i67LwFUJgjQ5Dz4zZgHgGduElnmSA%3D%3D&sender=TESTKHUQJXXNSDSTCIY35GL3XMLFWNFEYH3HNATVGBURZR7XJP7C6EYM6Y&type=keyreg&votefirst=1&votekey=G_lqTV6MKspW6J8wH2d8ZliZ5XZVZsruqSBJMwLwlmo%3D&votekeydilution=316&votelast=100000\\n```\\n\\n:::warning\\n\\nThe above URI is an example and will fail when posted to the network.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nThis feature is part of the larger body of work to integrating generating participation keys for nodes. See [generating participation keys](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/participate/generate_keys/) for more information.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nAlthough a plethora of Kibisis\' features are not for the casual user, we have been working hard on these little known features and will continue to push the the boundaries of what blockchain and a wallet can unlock.\\n\\n\x3c!-- just give a bulleted list of fixes, or omit if no fixes with in the release --\x3e\\n## Fixes\\n\\n* The quest threshold for sending assets has been lowered from greater or equal to 1, to greater than 0.\\n* Node URLs are used for network pings to avoid false positive network connectivity issues.\\n\\n## Closing Words\\n\\n\x3c!-- leave this paragraph as standard sign off --\x3e\\nThank you for your continued interest in Kibisis!

These quests have high multipliers and can only be performed once but may earn extra special rewards!\\n\\n## How do I start completing quests?\\n\\nWith the launch of v1.15.0, you will receive a message that will allow you to opt in to quests. Either press \\"Yes, I\'m in!\\" or \\"Cancel\\" if you wish to start completing quests.\\n\\nIf you missed the message or pressed cancel, and you have decided that you want to opt-in, you can go to **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Allow certain actions to be tracked?**.\\n\\n<BlogScreenshotImage\\n  label=\\"Allow action tracking from privacy settings\\"\\n  maxWidth=\\"400px\\"\\n  imageSources={{\\n    dark: allowActionTrackingDarkImage,\\n    light: allowActionTrackingLightImage,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\nYou can opt out at any time by repeating the above procedure and toggling off **Allow certain actions to be tracked?**.\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nWe will need to gather and transmit the quests to a remote server and each quest completion will be referenced by the address and/or asset ID that completed it. This is a small deviation from Kibisis\' [privacy policy](/privacy-policy) and, as such, we have updated the [privacy policy](/privacy-policy#usage-analytics-with-opt-in-option) to accommodate this new clause.

By default, Kibisis asks you to enter your password whenever you do a sensitive operation; operations that require access to the encrypted private key. However, you can now enable this in the settings:\\n\\n1. Open the Settings by click the \\"\u2699\ufe0f\\" button:\\n\\n<BlogScreenshotImage\\n  label=\\"Go to settings\\"\\n  maxWidth=\\"400px\\"\\n  imageSources={{\\n    dark: passwordLock1DarkImage,\\n    light: passwordLock1LightImage,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n2.

To start, you can import a wallet via a QR code.\\n\\n> \u26a0\ufe0f **NOTE:** This feature is still in development and please use at your own risk as the QR code, in its current form, holds an unencrypted private key.

v1.10.1!\\n\\n\x3c!-- re-write this paragraph for all new versions --\x3e\\nThis new update mainly focuses on some underlying infrastructure work that allows Kibisis to more robustly connect with dApps.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nBelow you will find more details about what is new in this release.\\n\\n\x3c!-- go into detail about the new versions, or omit if no new features with in the release --\x3e\\n## Features\\n\\n### UseWallet Support\\n\\nThe star feature in this release is support for the popular provider connector [UseWallet](https://github.com/TxnLab/use-wallet), produced by the excellent team over at [TxnLab](https://www.txnlab.dev/).\\n\\nKibisis will now be integrated as a provider with UseWallet, which means a lot of existing dapps will be able to support Kibisis as a wallet to sign your transactions.\\n\\nFor the dapp developers out there, all that is needed to allow Kibisis is specifying the Kibisis provider ID:\\n\\n<Tabs\\n

ARC-200 Asset\\n\\nA new button is now available on the asset page that allows you to \\"hide\\" an ARC-200 asset. This simply hides the asset from the asset holdings list.\\n\\n<BlogScreenshotImage\\n  label=\\"Hide ARC-200 asset\\"\\n  maxWidth=\\"400px\\"\\n  imageSources={{\\n    dark: hideArc200AssetDarkImage,\\n    light: hideArc200AssetLightImage,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\nYou can re-add the ARC-200 asset at any time without any impact to your funds.\\n\\nCredit goes to the ever awesome <a href=\\"https://github.com/d13co\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\"  target=\\"_blank\\">D13</a> for their work in suggesting and implementing this feature.\\n\\n### Pera Explorer Integration\\n\\nWith the release of Pera Explorer for Algorand MainNet and TestNets, it will now appear as an option in preferred block explorer list, and, in the case of Algorand TestNet, the default block explorer.\\n\\n### Remove Downloads Permission\\n\\nWe have moved the Strong Password Policy (the policy that sets out guidelines for passwords) to the external Kibisis website here: [https://kibis.is/strong-password-policy](https://kibis.is/strong-password-policy).\\n\\nThis means that we have removed the feature that allowed you to download the document locally, which, in-turn also removes the downloads permission.\\n\\n### Implementation Of The Proposed ARC-0027\\n\\nA new ARC has been proposed: [ARC-0027](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/pull/272). This ARC proposes the use of [BroadcastChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API) to securely handle communications between a browser extension and a webpage.\\n\\nVersion 1.10.1 has revamped its underlying infrastructure to move away from script injecting and to use the proposed ARC-0027.\\n\\n\x3c!-- just give a bulleted list of fixes, or omit if no fixes with in the release --\x3e\\n## Fixes\\n\\n* When importing an account on registration, the registration app should close and open the main app.\\n* Allow MainNet for Algorand correctly enables when confirming.\\n\\n## Closing Words\\n\\n\x3c!-- leave this paragraph as standard sign off --\x3e\\nThank you for your continued interest in Kibisis!

The new version of Kibisis, version 1.8.0, is all about supporting ARC-200 tokens, the sexy new type of AVM assets. But that\'s not all, we have also brought in Standard Asset opt-ins as well as various fixes that squash some annoying bugs.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nBelow you will find more details about what is new in this release.\\n\\n\x3c!-- go into detail about the new versions, or omit if no new features with in the release --\x3e\\n## Features\\n\\n### ARC-200 Support\\n\\nThe new ARC-200 token standard represents a major upgrade for assets on the AVM (Algorand Virtual Machine). They allow assets to utilize the power of smart contracts, by actually _being_ a smart contract!\\n\\nARC-200 tokens have been inspired by the equivalent [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) on EVM chains. ERC-20 tokens underpin almost all tokens on EVM and so it is only fitting that AVM also has an asset of similar standard.\\n\\nThe team here at Agora Labs have been working hard over Christmas to get ARC-200 support ready. With version 1.8.0, you can not add an ARC-200 asset, if you know the application ID:\\n\\n<BlogScreenshotImage\\n  label=\\"Add ARC-0200 asset\\"\\n  maxWidth=\\"400px\\"\\n  imageSources={{\\n    dark: addARC0200AssetDarkImage,\\n    light: addARC0200AssetLightImage,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\nThe beauty of ARC-200 is that it is _free_ to opt-in, yes that is right, ARC-200 does not require a fee to opt-in!\\n\\nOnce the ARC-200 asset has been added, it will appear in your asset holdings, and you will be able to check your balance, send and receive!\\n\\n<BlogScreenshotImage\\n  label=\\"ARC-0200 support\\"\\n  maxWidth=\\"400px\\"\\n  imageSources={{\\n    dark: arc0200SupportDarkImage,\\n    light: arc0200SupportLightImage,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\nTo learn more about ARC-200, make sure you check out the specification [here](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0200).\\n\\n### Standard Asset Opt-in\\n\\nAlthough there is a lot of talk about ARC-200, let us not forget one of the most powerful features of the AVM: Standard Assets. These assets are baked into the very heart of the AVM protocol and are a feature that makes AVM chains the best in class.\\n\\nThe new version of Kibisis allows you to opt-in to standard assets, using an opt-in transaction, which, at the time of writing will cost you 0.01; the standard fee amount.\\n\\n\x3c!-- just give a bulleted list of fixes, or omit if no fixes with in the release --\x3e\\n## Fixes\\n\\n* The amount field on the sending asset screen now correctly handles decimals.\\n* The send asset screen no longer shows a blank screen when coming from the settings page.\\n* Minor fixes.\\n\\n## Closing Words\\n\\n\x3c!-- leave this paragraph as standard sign off --\x3e\\nThank you for your continued interest in Kibisis!
