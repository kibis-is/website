## Overview

If you want to avoid the browser store, or you want to get the latest release, you can install Kibisis via a zip file.

## For Chrome/Chromium

1. Go to https://github.com/agoralabs-sh/kibisis-web-extension/releases/latest and download the latest release and select the zip file for Chrome: `kibisis-chrome-x.x.x.zip`.

  src={chromeManualInstallation001}
/>

:::caution

Make sure you download the version relevant for your browser, for Chrome/Chromium, this will be `kibisis-chrome-x.x.x.zip`.

:::

:::note

If you would like to try a pre-release version, the cutting edge version, go to https://github.com/agoralabs-sh/kibisis-web-extension/releases and selected the first one. Please air on the side of caution as this is early access, it is possibly unstable and may have breaking changes.

2. Unpack the downloaded zip file to a directory (make a note of this directory, you will need to point to it later).

3. Click on the overflow menu, and select **Extensions** > **Manage Extensions**.
